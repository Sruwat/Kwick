    content: `# Battery Swapping 101: Everything You Need to Know

Never worry about charging again! KWICK's innovative battery swapping network keeps you on the road and earning.

## What is Battery Swapping?

Battery swapping is a revolutionary system where you can exchange your depleted battery for a fully charged one in under 2 minutes. No waiting, no charging time – just swap and go!

## How It Works

### Step 1: Locate Nearest Station
Use the KWICK app to find the nearest battery swap station. We have 50+ stations across Delhi NCR.

### Step 2: Drive In
Pull up to the swap station. Our stations are strategically located near delivery hotspots.

### Step 3: Quick Swap
Our trained technicians will swap your battery in under 2 minutes. You can wait in the comfort of our waiting lounge.

### Step 4: Payment
Payment is automatically deducted from your KWICK wallet. Only ₹50 per swap!

## Station Locations

### Delhi
- Connaught Place
- Karol Bagh
- Lajpat Nagar
- Dwarka
- Rohini

### Noida
- Sector 18
- Sector 62
- Greater Noida West

## Cost Analysis

**Traditional Petrol**: ₹150-200 per 100km
**KWICK Battery Swap**: ₹50-75 per 100km

**Monthly Savings**: ₹3,000-₹5,000

## Pro Tips

1. **Plan Your Route**: Position yourself near swap stations
2. **Swap at 20%**: Don't wait until empty
3. **Use App**: Check station availability in real-time
4. **Peak Hours**: Stations can be busy 12-2 PM and 8-10 PM
5. **Backup Plan**: Always know the location of 2-3 nearby stations

## Environmental Impact

Every battery swap instead of petrol refueling saves:

- Contributes to cleaner cities

## Future Expansion

We're adding 20 more stations in Q1 2025 across NCR!

### Rajesh's Top 5 Tips:

1. **Start Early**: Begin at 8 AM to catch breakfast rush
2. **Location Matters**: Park near restaurant clusters
3. **Multi-Platform**: Use 3-4 apps simultaneously
4. **Maintain Ratings**: Customer service is everything
5. **Battery Strategy**: Swap at 20-25% battery
